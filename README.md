# Predicting Engagement and Strain via Speech Prosody

This repository provides Jupyter notebooks and scripts for the paper:  
**“Predicting Engagement and Strain via Speech Prosody”**

---

## Overview
We investigate how **speech prosody** (pitch, intensity, loudness, voice activity) can be used as a **non-intrusive proxy** for:  
- **Positive Affective Engagement** (emotional resilience)  
- **Perceived Mental Strain** (cognitive load)  

Data comes from the **SEWA dataset**, with separate analyses for English and German participants.  

---

## Methods
- Feature extraction: pitch variation, intensity, loudness, MFCCs, voice probability.  
- Models: regression, SVMs, and bootstrapped classification.  
- Ground truth: SEWA self-reports on engagement, enjoyment, boredom, and cognitive effort.  

---

## Key Findings
- Prosodic features predict both engagement and strain.  
- Stronger resilience markers were observed in **German speech**.  
- Cognitive load predictions were consistent across languages.

## Data Availability
The **SEWA dataset** cannot be redistributed. Access must be requested from the SEWA project: [http://sewaproject.eu](http://sewaproject.eu).
